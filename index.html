                <p>PV Sindhu born 5th July 1995, from Hyderabad, started playing badminton at the age of eight and then joined Gopichand Badminton Academy. Sindhu's first major recognition came in the form of the 5th Servo All India ranking championship in the under-10 category. With massive total earnings of $5.5 million and prize money of $500,000, Sindhu is also the top-grossing non-cricket athlete from the country, according to Forbes. “Sindhu remains India's most marketable female athlete…. She became the first Indian to win the season-ending BWF World Tour finals in 2018,” Forbes said.</p>
